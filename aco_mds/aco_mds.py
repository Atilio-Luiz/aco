# Algorithm ACO-MDS
#
# This algorithm aims to calculate a minimum dominating set 
# of a given simple undirected graph G.
# However, an optimal solution is not guaranteed.
#
# This algorithm is based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) meta-heuristic,
# implemented using the MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS) and the Hyper-Cube Framework (HCF).
# This algorithm also uses, as a local search step, the heuristic called
# Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS).
#
# Author: AtÃ­lio Gomes Luiz
# Date  : May 19th, 2024
#
# This algorithm is inspired on other algorithms contained in the following two papers: 
# Paper 1: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494619302200
# Paper 2: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494624000802
# The above two papers are based on theory that was developed in the following papers:
# Paper 3: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1275547
# Paper 4: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X00000431
